        Hello my name is Patton Le I am a 2nd year computer science student. Some fun facts about me are that I love to snowboard during the winter and I enjoy fishing in the summer. The reason I chose CSE as my major is because when coming into college I truely didn't know what other major would have suited me better than CSE as I've been interested in computers since childhood.
